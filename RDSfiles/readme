This package provides an integrative model, based on stacked generalization, for multiomics prediction of gestational age. Using leave-one-patient-out cross-validation and Elastic Net linear models, a model is built on each dataset and then combined into a final prediction.

Most of the analysis is performed in a highly parallel setting and the results are cached to save time.

Script names: cross-validation.R, load.R, main.R, traintest.R

Scripts: The scripts required for reproducing the p-values for each dataset apart, and the integrative model. Start from the main.R script.

Data: Data file contains the following variables,
"featurepatients" patients index.
"featuretimes" trimesters of pregnancy from 1 to 4 where 1-3 represents the first three trimesters from the beginning to delivery, and postpartum is denoted by 4.
"featureweeks" weeks of pregnancy from the beginning.
"InputData" 7 multiomics measurements corresponding to the 17 patients sampled at three trimesters of pregnancy. 'Cellfree RNA','PlasmaLuminex','SerumLuminex','Microbiome','ImmuneSystem','Metabolomics', 'PlasmaSomalogic' constitutes these 7 multiomics datasets.

RDSfiles: Buffer folder to help save time.
