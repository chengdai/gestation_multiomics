# Prediction of gestational age with multiomic data

This repo seeks to further analyze the data from [Ghaemi et al (2018)](https://academic.oup.com/bioinformatics/article/35/1/95/5047759), a multi-omic study that sought to predict gestational age from different 'omics approaches. In further analyzing the data, I sought to evaluate questions that were not clearly addressed in the original study. These questions specifically address issues such as batch effect, outlier detection, and the use a more simple machine learning approach. All figures are located in the `Figures` folder. Code necessary to reccreate the figures can be found in `pregnancy_multiomics.py`. Results of the reanalysis can be found in Final/Results.pdf
